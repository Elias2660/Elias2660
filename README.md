# Hi 👋

My name (if you haven't read already) is Elias, and I'm a current Senior at Stuyvesant High School 🏫 in Downtown Manhattan, New York City.

I'm a bookworm 📕, beekeeper 🐝, coder 🧑‍💻, and swimmer 🏊, and I enjoy coding up cool things and learning new stuff. My socials are listed in my profile, though I usually don't use them that much. 

I've recently created a half decent personal website, which is [here](https://elias2660.github.io/). If you have time, check it out!
