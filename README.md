# Hi 👋

My name (if you haven't read already) is Elias, and I'm a current Senior at Stuyvesant High School 🏫 in Downtown Manhattan, New York City.

I'm a bookworm 📕, beekeeper 🐝, coder 🧑‍💻, and swimmer 🏊, and I enjoy coding up cool things and learning new stuff. I would include my socials here at this point, but I don't regularly use them so I'm not going to.
